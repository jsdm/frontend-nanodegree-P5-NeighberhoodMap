README

This project was to do a searchable list that shows interesting points on a map.
My list is about interesting points in Nepal city. When first loading the page all list items are present and all markers are viewable on the Google map. Writing in the search bar at the top, updates the list with only the item that contains the letters searched.

Clicking on an item brings up a infowindow above the items marker and populates the information area with a clickable wikipedia header (to take you to Wikipedia) and a more elaborate 'snippet area' below with more information about the clicked list item.
